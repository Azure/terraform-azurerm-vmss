# Azure Virtual Machines Scale Sets Terraform Module

Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide high availability to your applications, and allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs.

This module deploys Windows or Linux virtual machine scale sets with Public / Private Load Balancer support and many other features.

## Default Local Administrator and the Password

This module utilizes __`azureadmin`__ as a local administrator on virtual machines. If you want to you use custom username, then specify the same by setting up the argument `admin_username` with valid user string.

By default, this module generates a strong password for all virtual machines. If you want to set the custom password, specify the argument `admin_password` with valid string.

This module also generates SSH2 Key pair for Linux servers by default, however, it is only recommended to use for dev environment. For production environments, please generate your own SSH2 key with a passphrase and input the key by providing the path to the argument `admin_ssh_key_data`.

## Pre-Defined Windows and Linux VM Images

Automatic OS image upgrades are enabled on this module, so it helps update management by safely and automatically upgrading the OS disk for all instances in the scale set. Once configured, the latest OS image published by image publishers is automatically applied to the scale set without user intervention. Upgrades batches of instances in a rolling manner each time a new image is published by the publisher.

Only certain OS platform images are currently supported. Following pre-defined Windows or Linux images are available with the automatic upgrade option. To deploy these images specify `linux_distribution_name` or `windows_distribution_name` argument with following distributions.

OS type |Available Pre-defined Images|
--------|----------------------------|
Linux |`ubuntu1804`, `ubuntu1604`, `centos75`, `coreos`
Windows|`windows2012r2dc`, `windows2016dc`, `windows2019dc`, `windows2016dccore`

## Custom Virtual Machine images

If the pre-defined Windows or Linux variants are not sufficient then, you can specify the custom image by setting up the argument `custom_image` with appropriate values. Custom images can be used to bootstrap configurations such as preloading applications, application configurations, and other OS configurations. For more information [check here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-custom-images)

```hcl
module "vmscaleset" {
  source  = "kumarvna/vm-scale-sets/azurerm"
  version = "1.0.0"

  # .... omitted

  os_flavor               = "linux"
  linux_distribution_name = "ubuntu1804"
  generate_admin_ssh_key  = false
  admin_ssh_key_data      = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
  instances_count         = 2

  custom_image = {
      publisher = "myPublisher"
      offer     = "myOffer"
      sku       = "mySKU"
      version   = "latest"
    }

  # .... omitted
```

## Custom DNS servers

This is an optional feature and only applicable if you are using your own DNS servers superseding default DNS services provided by Azure. Set the argument `dns_servers = ["4.4.4.4"]` to enable this option. For multiple DNS servers, set the argument `dns_servers = ["4.4.4.4", "8.8.8.8"]`

## Advanced Usage of the Module

### `disable_password_authentication` - enable or disable VM password authentication

While creating the Linux servers, its recommended to use ssh2 keys to log in than using a password. By default, this module generates the ssh2 key pair for Linux VM's. If you want the password to login Linux VM, set the argument `disable_password_authentication = false`, this instructs the module to create a random password.

### `enable_ip_forwarding` - enable or disable IP forwarding

The setting must be enabled for every network interface that is attached to the virtual machine that receives traffic that the virtual machine needs to forward. A virtual machine can forward traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it. While IP forwarding is an Azure setting, the virtual machine must also run an application able to forward the traffic, such as firewall, WAN optimization, and load balancing applications. IP forwarding is typically used with user-defined routes.

By default, this not enabled and set to disable. To enable the IP forwarding using this module, set the argument `enable_ip_forwarding = true`.

### `enable_accelerated_networking` for Virtual Machines

Accelerated networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, greatly improving its networking performance. This high-performance path bypasses the host from the data path, which reduces latency, jitter, and CPU utilization for the most demanding network workloads on supported VM types.

Accelerated Networking is supported on most general-purpose and compute-optimized instance sizes with two or more virtual CPUs (vCPUs). These supported series are Dv2/DSv2 and F/Fs.

On instances that support hyperthreading, accelerated networking is supported on VM instances with four or more vCPUs. Supported series are: D/Dsv3, D/Dsv4, E/Esv3, Ea/Easv4, Fsv2, Lsv2, Ms/Mms, and Ms/Mmsv2.

By default, this not enabled and set to disable. To enable the accelerated networking using this module, set the argument `enable_accelerated_networking = true`.

### `private_ip_address_allocation_type` - Static IP Assignment

The Internal Load Balancer Virtual IP is accessible within the entire virtual network as well as from on-premises and inter connected VNets through the secure IP Sec tunnel. By default, the Azure DHCP servers assign the private IPv4 address for the load balancer. You can specify static IP address for Internal load balancer. Unless necessary, you should never manually set the IP address.

By default this not enabled and set to be dynamic. To enable the static private IP using this module, set the argument `private_ip_address_allocation_type = "Static"` and set the argument `private_ip_address` with valid static private IP.

### `source_image_id` - Create a VM from a managed image

We can create multiple virtual machines from an Azure managed VM image. A managed VM image contains the information necessary to create a VM, including the OS and data disks. The virtual hard disks (VHDs) that make up the image, including both the OS disks and any data disks, are stored as managed disks. One managed image supports up to 20 simultaneous deployments.

When you use the managed VM image, custom image, or any other source image reference are not valid. By default, this not enabled and set to use predefined or custom images. To utilize Azure managed VM Image by this module, set the argument `source_image_id` with valid manage image resource id.

### `license_type` - Bring your own License to your Windows server

Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server allows you to use your on-premises Windows Server licenses and run Windows virtual machines on Azure at a reduced cost. You can use Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server to deploy new virtual machines with Windows OS.

By default, this is set to `None`. To use the Azure Hybrid Benefit for windows server deployment by this module, set the argument `license_type` to valid values. Possible values are `None`, `Windows_Client` and `Windows_Server`.

### `os_disk_storage_account_type` - OS disk for VM Instances

Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes that are managed by Azure and used with Azure Virtual Machines. Managed disks are like a physical disk in an on-premises server but virtualized. With managed disks, all you have to do is specify the disk size, the disk type, and provision the disk. Once you provision the disk, Azure handles the rest. The available types of disks are ultra disks, premium solid-state drives (SSD), standard SSDs, and standard hard disk drives (HDD).

By default, this module uses the standard SSD with Locally redundant storage (`StandardSSD_LRS`). To use other type of disks, set the argument `os_disk_storage_account_type` with valid values. Possible values are `Standard_LRS`, `StandardSSD_LRS` and `Premium_LRS`.

### `additional_data_disks_storage_account_type` - Data disk support to VM Instances

Azure virtual machine scale sets support VM instances with attached data disks. You can attach data disks when the scale set is created, or to an existing scale set.

By default, this module uses the standard Locally redundant storage (`Standard_LRS`). To use other type of disks, set the argument `additional_data_disks_storage_account_type` with valid values. Possible values are `Standard_LRS`, `StandardSSD_LRS` and `Premium_LRS`.

This module also supports attaching data disks by setting up the argument `additional_data_disks = [100, 300]` with valid disk size in GB.

> Note: When you create a scale set with attached data disks, you need to mount and format the disks from within a VM to use them (just like for standalone Azure VMs). A convenient way to complete this process is to use a Custom Script Extension that calls a script to partition and format all the data disks on a VM.

### `single_placement_group` - large scale sets

By default, a scale set consists of a single placement group with a maximum size of 100 VMs. If a scale set property called singlePlacementGroup is set to false, the scale set can be composed of multiple placement groups and has a range of 0-1,000 VMs.

By default this is enabled and set to `true`. To change this value to allow multiple placement groups set the argument `single_placement_group = false`

### `assign_public_ip_to_each_vm_in_vmss` - Public IP per Virtual Machine

In general, Azure scale set virtual machines do not require their own public IP addresses. For most scenarios, it is more economical and secure to associate a public IP address to a load balancer or to a Bastion server, which then routes incoming connections to scale set virtual machines as needed.

However, some scenarios do require scale set virtual machines to have their own public IP addresses. An example is where virtual machines need to make external connections to one another across regions in a distributed database.

To create a scale set that assigns a public IP address to each virtual machine, set the argument `assign_public_ip_to_each_vm_in_vmss = true`

### `enable_automatic_instance_repair` - Automatically repair unhealthy Instances

Enabling automatic instance repairs for Azure virtual machine scale sets helps achieve high availability for applications by maintaining a set of healthy instances. If an instance in the scale set is found to be unhealthy as reported by Application Health extension or Load balancer health probes, then this feature automatically performs instance repair by deleting the unhealthy instance and creating a new one to replace it.

When an instance goes through a state change operation because of a PUT, PATCH or POST action performed on the scale set (for example reimage, redeploy, update, etc.), then any repair action on that instance is performed only after waiting for the grace period. Grace period is the amount of time to allow the instance to return to healthy state. Grace period is specified in minutes in ISO 8601 format and has a default value of 30 minutes.

The automatic instance repair feature can be enabled while creating a new scale set by setting up the argument `enable_automatic_instance_repair = true` and the grace period can be managed using the argument `grace_period = "PT30M"`. Default grace period is 30 minutes.

## Network Security Groups

By default, the network security groups connected to Network Interface and allow necessary traffic and block everything else (deny-all rule). Use `nsg_inbound_rules` in this Terraform module to create a Network Security Group (NSG) for network interface and allow it to add additional rules for inbound flows.

In the Source and Destination columns, `VirtualNetwork`, `AzureLoadBalancer`, and `Internet` are service tags, rather than IP addresses. In the protocol column, Any encompasses `TCP`, `UDP`, and `ICMP`. When creating a rule, you can specify `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP` or `*`. `0.0.0.0/0` in the Source and Destination columns represents all addresses.

*You cannot remove the default rules, but you can override them by creating rules with higher priorities.*

module "vmscaleset" {
  source  = "kumarvna/vm-scale-sets/azurerm"
  version = "1.0.0"
